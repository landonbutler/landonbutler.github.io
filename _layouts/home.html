        Hello! I'm Landon, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm concurrently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and a Bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering, seeking to better understand the systems that comprise the world around us from a data-driven perspective.

        My research lies at the confluence of network science and machine learning, 
        where I use mathematical and computational approaches to control, learn, 
        and infer the dynamics of complex real-world systems. 
        So far, I've had the opportunity to research for 
        <a class="homepageLinks" href="https://landonbutler.github.io/research#datadistribution">
        data distribution polices within robot teams</a>, 
        <a class="homepageLinks" href="https://landonbutler.github.io/research#multigraph">
            multigraph learning frameworks</a>, and
            <a class="homepageLinks" href="https://landonbutler.github.io/research#anomalydetection">anomaly detection techniques for hypergraphs</a>.

        I'm also passionate about sharing about these fields through teaching. 
        At Penn, I've been a teaching assistant for three courses: 
        an undergraduate level course in data science, 
        a master's level course in applied machine learning, 
        and a PhD level course on graph neural networks. 
        You can learn more about my teaching of these courses

        Outside of academics, I'm a percussionist in the Penn Band and 
        <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZbI4XdOvA8">
        write drum scores in my spare time</a>.
