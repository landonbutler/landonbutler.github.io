        Hello! I'm Landon, a senior at the <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I'm concurrently pursuing a Master's degree in <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://dats.seas.upenn.edu/">Data Science</a> and a Bachelor's degree in <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu/undergraduate/">Systems Engineering</a>, seeking to better understand the systems that comprise the world around us from a data-driven perspective. Additionally, I'm interested in learning how to leverage a broad range of quantitive and computational skills, and hence, am minors in <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/undergraduate/program-options/minor-in-cs/">Computer Science</a>, <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/undergraduate/math-majors-and-minors/mathematics-minor">Mathematics</a>, and <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/programs/undergraduate/statistics-minor/">Statistics</a>.

        My research lies at the confluence of <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="http://www.network-science.org/">network science</a> and m<a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/">machine learning</a>, where I develop and apply learning algorithms to dynamical systems situated on networks. So far, I've had the opportunity to research <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://landonbutler.github.io/research/">data distribution polices amongst robot teams</a> and <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://landonbutler.github.io/research/">anomaly detection on social networks</a>.

        Recently, I've began a Head Teaching Assistantship in the <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/master-of-computer-and-information-technology/">MCIT online program</a> for <a target="_blank" class="homepageLinks" href="https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit-online-course-list/">ESE 542: Statistics for Data Science</a>. I'm passionate about sharing these skills with budding data scientists, as learning how to capture, intepret, and leverage data will be pivotal for many careers over the next few decades.
